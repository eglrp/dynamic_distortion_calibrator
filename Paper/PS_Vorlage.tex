\begin{Zusammenfassung}
Kameras als Sensoren werden in immer mehr Applikationem im allt\"aglichen Leben wie zum Beispiel in Smartphones, oder um unser Haus mit Hilfe von Smart-Home-Systemen zu \"uberwachen, verwendet. In Fabriken hingegen werden noch viel mehr Kameras zur \"Uberwachung von verschiedensten Prozessen wegen ihrer universellen Anwendung, niedrigen Kosten und dem Potenzial der erhaltenen Daten verwendet. Au\ss{}erdem w\"achst ihre Rolle im Automobilbereich. Jedoch ist jede Kameralinse aufgrund von nicht exakt gleichm\"a\ss{}igen Fertigungstechniken mehr oder weniger gekr\"ummt. Die meisten Kameras zeigen eine radiale Verzerrung, da die Linsen in der Regel eine konvexe Kr\"ummung aufweisen. Diese ist nicht immer gleichm\"a\ss{}ig konvex oder hat Einschl\"usse, die die Verzerrung zu einem sehr nichtlinearen Verhalten ver\"andert. Das macht die Kalibrierung des Kameraobjektivs zu einem wesentlichen Aspekt der Computer Vision, da eine hohe Genauigkeit ihrer Bilder erforderlich ist. Die meisten Kamerakalibrierungen erfordern menschliche Interaktionen wie die Kalibrierung mit einem Schachbrettmuster. In dieser Ausarbeitung wird eine L\"osung f\"ur die Kamera-Kalibrierung vorgestellt, die auf einem planaren Display wie g\"angigen Computermonitoren arbeitet und nicht auf menschliche Interaktion st\"utzt. Dabei wird eine Karte zwischen den Bildschirmpixeln und den projezierten Karmerabildpixeln bestimmt. Wir pr\"asentieren verschiedene Wege, die wir mit ihren Vor- und Nachteilen in Genauigkeit und Laufzeit ausprobiert haben.

\begin{abstract}
Cameras as a sensor application are widely used in our daily life like in smartphones or to surveille our home via smart home installation. But even more cameras monitor many processes in factories because of their universal application, low cost and the potential of the obtained data. Also it influence in the automotive branche is rising. However, every camera lens is more or less distorted due to imperfect manufacturing techniques. Most cameras show radial distortion due to the fact that most lenses have convex curvature. These aren't always perfectly convex or got inclusions which do alter the distortion to a very non-linear behavior. That makes calibration of the camera lens an essential aspect of computer vision, since a high accuracy of their images is required. Most camera calibrations require human interactions like the calibration with a checkerboard. In this paper a solution to camera calibration is shown that works on a 2D planar display like common used computer monitors and doesn't rely on human interaction. Therefore a mapping between the screen pixel coordinate system and the image pixel coordinate system is determined. We present different ways we tried with their pros and cons in accuracy and runtime.

\section{Introduction}

\PARstart{C}{ameras} are used in more and more situations. Application areas are monitoring technologies, toys, smartphones and increasingly in vehicles for example. However all camera lenses are somewhat different from each other. The curvature of a lens is never perfect, and inclusions may occur which also alter the curvature of the incident light. This leads to distortion that has to be calibrated. State of the art approaches like the checkerboard calibration only base their models on a few interest points. This method for calibration is to position a checkerboard in different poses in front of the camera and detect the intersections of the black and white squares. The more pictures are done the higher is accuracy of the result what increases the human interaction and the time invested. We present this and other methods in Chapter \ref{sec:related}. 
Our aim was to develop a program, which automatically creates a dense model of the lens distortion. This dense model is based on information of the correspondencies of pixels on a screen and the pixels in a captured image. Once the mapping between the screen and the image corresponding pixels is done, we can undistort the image simply by moving the pixels of the actual image we take. In order to reach the desired accuracy we need to set some pre-conditions for the environment in which this takes place. These conditions are darkness, in order to avoid reflections of the camera on the screen, and the camera being perpendicular to the screen. We will present the fundamental principles of several different ideas, which all result in a mapping. To compare them we give a short insight to their runtimes. This article is structured as follows: First follows the related work in \ref{sec:related} then in Chapter \ref{sec:maths} the theoretical  foundations are outlined. Chapter \ref{sec:mapping} includes the idea and realization of the project. In Chapter \ref{sec:results} is the conclusion.


\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
Several approaches has been proposed in order to calibrate a camera, they can roughly be classified into two categories [1]: photogrammetric calibration and self-calibration.
Photogrammetric calibration is based on a spatial object with its 3D shape known which is placed in the view of camera. The commonly used object is planar object point array, so called checkerboard pattern [1], or a 3D cube with determined pattern on it. This method is restricted because errors will occur while printing and manually measuring the pattern or also if the pattern isn't always available.\\
In self-calibration [3] a reference object is not required, instead it requires the correspondence between points of the scene and the projection. Duane C B. [5] proposed a nonmetric method, based on the fact that the projection of a straight line from the world space should also be a straight line on the image. Swaminathan R and Nayar S K. [6] extended this method by reducing noise and using polycamera. However, this method still relies on calculating parameters, which is not accurate because the model is simplified. 
Sagawa R  proposed a way using structured light to determine the correspondence and creates directly a dense map so that the error generated by parameter fitting is reduced. 
The system proposed is based on [4] since they are both based on detecting the correspondence of lines and get the map non-parametrically. %\cite{Faugeras:1992}

\section{Mathematical Backround}
\label{sec:maths}

\section{Mapping of correspondencing pixels}
\label{sec:mapping}
Our aim was to create a map of corresponding pixels of the screen to the camera image. For that we followed different approaches which we evaluate by accuracy in Chapter \ref{sec:results} and by runtime in Chapter \ref{sec:runtime}. \\
Before we begin with the mapping of the correspondencies we will discuss the setup of the device. The camera should be in a distance to the screen that it only detects the screen and nothing else like the borders or so. We should be able to manipulate the entire visible flat surface to excite every pixel on the camera image. The background color of the monitor should be black so that drawn white pixels can be better recognized. The camera and the display should be in a locked dark area where no light is coming so the monitor is the only light source. This leads to no unwanted reflections that sophisticate our result. If the camera is adjusted perpendicular to the display the program could run.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./pics/setup.png}
\caption{Setup of Camera and Monitor}
\label{fig:setup}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\\
 First we have to make sure, that the captured image contains at least one position at which the screen is going to display a rectangle. To do this we draw a set amount of rectangles evenly spaced on the screen. Initially these rectangles have a \emph{width} and \emph{height} of $1$. While the camera doesn't detects a pixel we increase \emph{width} and \emph{height} of the drawn rectangle by $1$ until it does recognise a drawn pixel. This is shown in algorithm~\ref{algo:pixelsize}. In order to ensure, that the detection was not a accidental chance of luck, the same size has to be confirmed by further detections. 
\begin{algorithm}[h]
 \KwData{cameraImage}
 \KwResult{returns pixelSize}
 initialization: int pixelSize = 1\;
 \While{(notDetected)}{
  \eIf{(maxBrightnestPixel != 0)}{
   notDetected = false\;
   return pixelSize\;
   }{
   notDetected=true\;
   pixelSize++\;
  }
 }
 \caption{pixel size detection}
 \label{algo:pixelsize}
\end{algorithm} 
 
 After the pixel size that is seen by the camera is detected we draw a pixel with that size on the screen that is moving with a spacing. That means that the pixel always gets a new coordinate that with a calculated distance in vertical and/or horizontal  direction. Therefore we're able to calculate an optimal spacing for a specific method of us which is described at the end of Chapter \ref{sec:linebased}. While the pixel is moving on the screen we accumulatively add the $x_s$ and $y_s$ positions of the seen rectangles on the screen. Simultanously we enumerate the number of seen rectangles. The algorithm is shown in \ref{algo:centerPoint}.
 
\begin{algorithm}[h]
 \KwData{pixelPosition}
 \KwResult{returns centerPoint}
 initialization: int counter = 0\;
 \While{(pixelPosition < display)}{
  \eIf{(pixelSeen)}{
   centerPoint += pixelPosition\;
   counter++\;
   }{
   centerPoint /= counter\;
   }
 }
 \caption{calculation of center point of FOV}
 \label{algo:centerPoint}
\end{algorithm} 

As you will see in the following chapters, these two methods are fundamental to most of our approaches. Where the pixelSize is not necessary for the algorithm itself, we still use it to generate a test image. To this test image the found distortion maps are applied. Therefore they are necessary in any case. In the next three Subchapter we'll present two principle different possibilities we obtained while this work how it could be possible to get a distortion calibration with a higher accuracy than the state of the art. 
 

\subsection{Pixelwise approaches}
Our first idea was a matching from every screen pixel to his corresponding pixel in the image. We developed three different methods. These were faster in their implementation in this order, with the same accuracy. The duration of the individual methods is given in Chapter \ref{sec:runtime} with an exact minimum value for our example.
\subsubsection{every Pixel}
The first and easiest idea was to light a rectangle with minimum pixel size after another and row for row. If we see a drawn rectangle save the correspondencies of the image and the screen coordinate. Later we could have checked if an imaginary straight line of rectangles on the screen will be to a straight line of pixels on the image. If not we knew we have to move the image pixels so that the line that is seen on the image is also straight.
\subsubsection{For the sake of the \textbf{SPIRAL}}
However it's not very efficient if we light every pixel of the screen with the seen pixel size. As the seen area on the screen the field of view (FOV) could be significant smaller than the screen we developed another method to ensure a faster result. For this purpose we produce generate the idea to let the rectangle move on a spirallike path on the screen. The algorithm \ref{algo:centerPoint} was designed to find a optimal starting position to that spiral. After finding the center point of the FOV the rectangle moved slowly to the outside of the FOV. While the pixel wasn't seen for a hole circulation we know we should still be in vision of the camera. So everytime a rectangle is seen it's position on the screen and the camera image is saved for later for the distortion calibration. Exposing the view area in spiral-shape, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:runtime}, is not exactly fast. In addition, the method is very inefficient for fisheye cameras or any kind of wide angle cameras. 

%% mathematics and basics -> some pictures with different distortion shapes
\subsubsection{by lines}
The pixelwise distortion calibration was our last concept in which we tried to detect a solution by lighting several rectangles with the minimum pixel size. However this method is already a hybrid since we introduced real line detection methods here to solve the problem of distortion calibration. In the further discussed methods we used the pixel correspondencies and calculated the lines in both images, the drawn and the detected one. In this method we drew lines in the seen area and detect their position in the camera image and wanted to correct them then. However we need to detect the borders of the seen area first. For that we are forced to find at least one border of the seen area. Therfore we developed a binary search algorithm that finds a border. The initial point to that algorithm is the center point we already detected with algorithm~\ref{algo:centerPoint}. From there we assumed that a point at any border of the screen is not seen by the camera. Then we check if a point between this two points is seen or not. If not we check between this and center point and else we check between that and the point of the border. This is described in algorithm~\ref{algo:binary}. 


\begin{algorithm}[h]
 \KwData{pixelPosition}
 \KwResult{returns borderPoint}
 initialization: \;
 point lastSeen = centerPoint\;
 point lastNotseen = screenBorder\;
 point nextPos\;
 \While{(abs(lastSeen - lastNotSeen)>1)}{
 nextPos = (lastSeen+lastNotSeen)/2\;
  \eIf{(pixelSeen)}{
   lastSeen = pixelPosition\;
   }{
   lastNotSeen = pixelPosition\;
   }
 }
 pixelPosition = nextPos\;
 return borderPoint = (lastSeen+lastNotSeen)/2\;
 \caption{binary search algorithm for border detection}
 \label{algo:binary}
\end{algorithm} 
In the process of this work the binary search showed that absolute darkness around the setup is necessary because otherwise we're losing vision on pixels in the outer area of the camera image. \\After a border is found our purpose was to find all corresponding screen pixels that belongs to the frame of the camera image. If these are found our idea was to draw lines with \emph{width} for vertical lines and the \emph{height} for horizontal lines of the minimum pixel size on the screen that are straight. Then we should have been able to calibrate the distortion with the next two shown images. However it would have needed still a long time to detect the borders. Since around a pixel there are 8 possible positions to detect the next one that belongs to the frame. Even if you can exclude some of these possible positions if you know at which border you are and in which directory you want to move around the frame, at least 4 possible positions remain. %% Picture Positions? 
In Chapter \ref{sec:runtime} we calculated the minimum time required for an exemplary FOV. However we dismissed this method too because we found a way faster solution with a line detection by a \emph{openCV}--function called \emph{Canny}. 

\subsection{simple linedetection for x and y matching}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./pics/rect.png}
\caption{rectangle over the screen}
\label{fig:setup}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We set the backround of the screen to black. Then we draw a white rectangle with height of the screen height and an increasing width. In figure \ref{fig:blockOverTime} we show how the rectangle is getting wide. At the border of the white rectangle to the black backround the \emph{Canny}-operator detects the points of the border as a line. The return of that operation is a point cloud of image coordinates that belong to that line. To every image pixel that in that point cloud we match the $x$--coordinate to which it should belong. We enlarge the width of the rectangle until it disappears from the FOV. After that we do the same with another rectangle that is as width as the screen width and height of one minimum pixel size \emph{height}. We'll get again every pixel that belongs to that line in a point cloud by the \emph{Canny}--operator. Now we can match the $y$--coordinates to the points which are obtained, since they always belong to the actual drawn line. At the end of Chapter \ref{sec:runtime} we calculated the runtime of this method. It is significantly faster than any of the other methods we have presented so far. However, it can be accelerated even more, if not always a pixel size is increased, but several. Therefore we wrote a interpolation function that interpolates linearily between matched pixels. In future it could be tested if another interpolation method besides linear interpolation give better results. In case of radial distortion a radius to the center point dependent interpolation could return better results.

\subsection{runtimes of the approaches}
\label{sec:runtime}
\subsubsection{pixelwise}
\label{sec:pixelwise}
Each frame makes one call to the draw function. Given that we need $7$ calls of the draw function to fully draw, capture, and process one image, we can, with a frame rate of $21$ frames per second (FPS), achieve turnover rate of $3$ images per second. This allows us to make an estimation of the runtime of each approach we tested out or considered for the lens calibration. For the following estimates we're assuming a screen of the dimensions $1290$x$1080$ pixels and a FOV of roughly $670$x$395$ pixels for the camera. The FOV has been experimentally determined for a distance of 16 cm from the screen. From the results the aperture angle can be calculated, it yields roughly $\angle 68.45^{\circ}$, the camera’s specifications state an aperture angle of $\angle 68.50^{\circ}$. So these results should be a good estimate of the true FOV. Furthermore the assumption is made that each pixel can be detected on its own, instead of needing larger patches to be detectable by the camera.
The following variables will be use: $h_{FOV}$ as the height of the FOV, $w_{FOV}$ as the width of the FOV, $w_s$ as the width of the screen, and $h_s$ as the height of the screen.
1. Singular pixel detection
With a naive approach each patch of minimal detectable size on the screen has to be turned on separately. This means screen width times screen height necessary images. In our set up $921,600$ images would be needed, yielding a runtime of $307,200$ seconds, or $3$ days $13$ hours $20$ minutes.
It can be sped up however. By lighting up single pixels in a spiral pattern around an estimation of the middle point, the amount of images can be reduced to the amount of pixels within the camera’s FOV runtime to roughly $88,572$ seconds, or $1$ day $1$ hour $30$ minutes.
The center point estimation has been left out, as it is comparably negligible.\\
	
\subsubsection{Line-based detection} 
\label{sec:linebased}
The first idea for a line-based detection was to first detect the borders and store how the border pixels of the image map to the screen. The idea was to first detect a pixel on the border via binary search and then move this pixel to new positions to check whether these are seen. We need to check at least four surrounding pixels for visibility. This means $4 \cdot (2 \cdot h_{FOV} + 2 \cdot w_{FOV})$, in our setup that leads to $8,520$ images. To process these images, we need $2,840$ seconds, or $47$ minutes $20$ seconds. After discovering the border only two images need to be created and processed. However, since the discovery of the border would take still too long, we rejected this method as well.
The next method is a segmentation of the screen. By segmenting the screen sequentially in a black and a white part, we can detect a single edge in the image. The white part starts out as the entire screen and gradually decreases in width, pixel by pixel. After that is done, the white part is again stretched out over the entire screen and then decreases in height. At each image we know exactly at which position the screen shows the edge. From this we can calculate where the edge pixels from the image should have appeared.
When doing this naively and simply going over the entire screen width and height, this method needs to process $2,370$ images. It would take $790$ seconds, or $13$ minutes $10$ seconds. This is already immensely faster. It can still be sped up, however.
Instead of going over the entire screen, we first estimate the center point again. This time we additionally store which was the outermost pixel, which was visible during the estimation, for each border. From there we add the spacing, that was used, plus a small margin to be safe. The margin was chosen to be $5$ pixels wide. In this method the runtime for the center point estimation is relevant. While the runtime for the center point estimation increases with smaller spacing, the runtime for the line-based detection decreases. This means a runtime-optimal spacing can be calculated.
Let s be the spacing between the positions of the pixels to be lit, and m the margin. Then the runtime of the center estimation, as a function of spacing s, is:
\begin{align}
rt_c (s) = \frac{w_s\cdot h_s}{ s^2} = 1393200 / s^2.
\end{align}
For the runtime of the line-based detection after that, follows:
\begin{align}
rt_d (s) = 4s + 4\cdot m + w_{FOV} + h_{FOV} = 4s + 1085
\end{align}
From there the overall runtime can be calculated as:
\begin{align}
rt(s) = \frac{1393200}{s^2} + 4s +1085.
\end{align}
This functions minimum is at roughly s = 89. For this spacing we need then $1,617$ images, leading to a runtime of $539$ seconds, or nearly $9$ minutes. Of these roughly $59$ seconds are center point estimation.
